Work in progress of a simple grid system created with the golden ratio principle.

Eventually I will port this to Compass as an extension, as it is built using sass and compass.

* relies on Compass utilities library to use float mixins for now. Please import compass/utilities to use properly.
* will not work unless used with SASS and Compass currently
